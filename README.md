NTRODUCTION
 
This project is part one in a series of three, which you will complete in this semester. In 
the projects scenario, you are one member of a software development team responsible 
for the design and development of a business solution for Electronic Telethon Systems 
(ETS).  
The ETS tracks donations called in by telephone during a telethon.  The system keeps 
track of each donation, each donor, and the allocation of prizes.  Every donation is paid in 
full by credit card at the time it is taken. This system runs on a single computer. 
The current application was designed and developed using structured programming 
techniques. The company for which you work has decided to update existing programs 
using object-oriented and structured programming techniques. 

YOUR ROLE
 
You are assigned to create an application with a graphical interface using Windows forms 
and components and C# object-oriented programming language.  

OBJECTIVES
 
The objectives of this project are: 
• Create an application with a graphical interface
• Write an event-driven program using an object-oriented language
• Use a custom class library to demonstrate reusability
• Read from a file
• Write to a file
• Use the three structured theorem programming constructs where applicable
• Debug and handle errors to produce an error-free application
